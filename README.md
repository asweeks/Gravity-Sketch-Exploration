# Gravity-Sketch-Exploration

The focus of this project was to learn the baisics of the Virtual Reality modeling program GravitySketch
I created four models with increasing complexity, in order to develop my knowledge of the programs features and uses.


## Basic Features
This is a short video demonstrating some of the features of the program.

## Model #1: Space Bike
The space bike was modeled out of primatives and was my first step in vr modeling.

## Model #2: Space Buggy
With the space buggy I began to experiment with subdivision modeling and more advanced techniques.

## Model #3: Space Ship
The space ship is a continuation of what I learned in the buggy, a focus of a main sub devided body and less complicated accents.

## Model #4: Space Cruiser
The space cruiser is the most advanced model, and uses more complex subdivision techniques.

## In Conclusion

Gravitysketch is a super intuitive program with many great uses, from creating quick cad models to getting a sense of scale and proportion, vr modeling allows the designer to enhance their process and experince their design in a new way.
